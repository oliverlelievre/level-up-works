## Folder Structure (just suggestion, you can set up your own group project structure):
- folder 'public'
    - folder images (refer to public-images folder)
- folder 'src'
    - folder 'Components' (All re-usable components)
    - folder 'Styling' (All CSS modules required)
    - folder 'Pages' (All Pages which import re-usable components)
    - folder 'images' (refer to src-assets)

Ideally No new folders are to be created unless discussed first to avoid conflicts/confusion.

## Name Conventions:

- All components/pages should be written in camelCase but with the first letter capitalised: 
        - ie: HomePageNavBar.js - HomePageFooter.js - StudentProfileNavBar.js

- All CSS styling className are to named with camelCase 
    - When naming classNames please reference which page/component your module relates to.
        - ie: HomePageNavBar.module.css - HomePageFooter.module.css - StudentProfileNavBar.module.css
